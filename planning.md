- **Countdown Effects**: Audio cues for game transitions

#### Deliverables:
- Immersive audio-visual experience
- Professional-quality game feedback
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Phase 5: Bug Fixes & Optimization ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: Quality assurance phase
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### Critical Issues Resolved:
- [x] **Card Selection Delay**: Fixed slow response (was taking several seconds)
  - **Solution**: Removed unnecessary setTimeout delays in selectCard()
- [x] **Over-Conservative AI**: Fixed AI folding too much early game
  - **Solution**: Adjusted aggression levels and early-stage participation logic
- [x] **Game Hanging**: Fixed freeze when user folded and only 1 AI remained
  - **Solution**: Modified checkAllPlayersReady() for single-player scenarios
- [x] **Turn Display Timing**: Fixed AI action before turn indicator
  - **Solution**: Restructured processAITurn() to show turn first, action after 0.5s
- [x] **Simple Victory Music**: Enhanced basic scale to full orchestral fanfare
  - **Solution**: Multi-layered audio with melody, harmony, and drums

#### Performance Optimizations:
- Efficient React re-renders
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Memory management for audio contexts

#### Deliverables:
- Bug-free gameplay experience

- [x] planning.md (This file)
- [x] tasks.md (Development task tracking)
- [x] README.md (Project overview and setup)

#### Deliverables:
- Complete project documentation
- Technical architecture guide
- Development history and decisions

## Development Methodology

### Iterative Development Approach
1. **User Feedback-Driven**: Each enhancement was based on direct user feedback
2. **Incremental Improvements**: Small, focused changes to avoid introducing bugs
3. **Real-time Testing**: Immediate testing after each change
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous attention to responsiveness and smoothness

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Consistent code patterns and conventions
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Efficient state management with React hooks

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual Testing**: Comprehensive gameplay testing for each feature
- **Edge Case Testing**: Scenarios like early folding, single players, etc.
- **Performance Testing**: Animation smoothness and audio quality
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across modern browsers

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Framework Choices
- **Next.js 15.4.4**: Latest features and performance improvements
- **React 18**: Concurrent features and improved rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid development

### State Management
- **Client-side Only**: No backend required for single-player with AI
- **React Hooks**: useState/useEffect for simple, effective state management
- **Local Game State**: All game logic runs in browser for low latency

### Audio Strategy
- **Web Speech API**: Text-to-speech for immediate action feedback
- **Web Audio API**: Dynamic music generation without audio files
- **Layered Audio**: Multiple oscillators for rich, orchestral sound

### Animation Approach
- **Framer Motion**: Physics-based animations for natural movement
- **Spring Physics**: Realistic card dealing and UI transitions
- **Performance First**: 60fps target with efficient re-renders

## Lessons Learned

### Development Insights
1. **User Feedback is Critical**: Direct user input led to the most important improvements
