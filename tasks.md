  - **Result**: Proper game flow continuation in all scenarios

- [x] **Turn Display Timing Fix** - UX improvement
  - **Issue**: AI actions happening before turn indicator shown
  - **Root Cause**: Race condition in processAITurn()
  - **Solution**: Restructure to show turn first, then action after 0.5s
